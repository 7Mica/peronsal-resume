    <p>
      As a person, I'm always trying to find the way to be a btter Software
      Developer and improve my programming skills and learn new software trends.
      Another thought that i have is working as a team is one of the best things
      that people can do, becaouse there are things that you don;t learn by your
      self and the support as team mates is worth.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there is something that I don't know i can easily learn it from
      scratch. If there is an opportunity to be part of your company I will do
      my best to do a great work and I am always ready to face new challenges.
